      How to Win

      There are 100 occupiable planets in the game, of the types Barren,
      Sub-terran, and Terran.  The object of the game is to colonize 60
      percent of the worlds, or destroy all the other players.  To
      Accomplish this you need to map out the playing grid  based on the
      info that your scanners receive, be a strategist, a tactician, and an
      economist.

      Your transportation among the stars is the formidable VH-SC1 Star
      Cruiser.  It comes equipped with a standard NCO Bi-cycle Ramscoop
      Stardrive, Augmentation, crew and enough space in the cargo area to
      house the Carrier Intrepid.  The government has opened up this
      frontier of space to privateers and Colonialists as a means of
      settling and civilizing the area.  So as Commander of your personally
      owned Star Cruiser, this makes succeeding in your venture all the more
      challenging.  If you win: Fame, Glory and wealth beyond belief.  Of
      course if you loose, it's your livelyhood, and maybe the crew, and
      your life as well!!!

      As you explore and trade, you'll come upon sources of various
      equiptment to add to your ship and colonies.  These Items are
      explained on the equiptment list below.


      GENERAL RULES:
      Exploring New Worlds: Your scan report will tell you if you spotted a
      new world. But the only way to tell what type of world it is, is to
      move into the sector. You may move into a sector and colonize on the
      same turn.

      Map Grid:  Each player will get a map and a starting location, with at
      least one occupied alien world. The map grid is for the play test is
      30 heigh by 40 wide. There is a boundary around the map grid and you
      cant see or move beyond the edges.  There are some undocumented
      hazards.  Ionic Storms, Worm holes, Meteor belts, for example.

      Playtest Rules:  All advanced features will be enabled for the
      playtest, except for the CET device.  Also all planets will be
      considered Terran.  There are approximately 60 planets, not including
      the trade planets.  Hazards do nothing in the playtest version.
      All players start out at in the center of the map.  All players
      get 1200 Cr. and 4 Missles.  The map will be an open explored
      map from the beginning of the game 34 by 44.

      Equipment List
      Max: This is the number of each item you may have on
      the ship, but in the case of Missiles, it's the number that may be
      fired each turn.

      Energy: This is the cost to use this particular item.  If there is a
      '/' next to the item, then it is the cost to use each of them. Firing
      5 missiles cost .5 energy pts.  On your turn sheet your you will find
      the number of energy you can expend for your current turn.  For every
      2 points of damage your engines have, your energy output is reduced
      by one.  Write down on your turn sheet where you would like to expend
      your energy points.  (e.g.:"2.5 on movement; .2 on scanning; .3 on
      missiles; .5 on refining;  1.5 on shields".)

      Cost: This is the cost to purchase the item at any of the alien
      worlds.  This cost is multiplied by the Economic rating at the
      world.  So if you are buying a tech 1 engine at a world with an
      Eco-rating of 1.1, you can expect to pay 5,500. Damage: This is the
      damage that the individual system can sustain before becoming
      useless.  The exception is Spares and Missiles.  If you have 5
      Missiles (or Spares) and there is damage on your missile (or Spares)
      system, all remaining missiles (or Spares) become useless.  On the
      other hand if one shuttle becomes damaged, all of the others do not
      become damaged.  The unit is called a credit or Cr.

      Start: At the start of the game you have one Star Class Cruiser with
      the following items:  One Star Cruiser Frame, 3 missiles, 3 armor
      units, 1 standard engine, 2 mining drones, 1 cargo hull, 1 scanner,
      and 5 spares.  The Cruiser frame itself is capable of carrying 10,000
      units of ore.

      Tech:  Each alien world you encounter will have a tech-rating. You can
      purchase that tech levels supplies or lower.  At a tech 3 world you
      can purchase tech 1, 2 or 3 stuff.  But at a tech 1 world you can
      only purchase tech level 1 stuff.

                                             actions maybe taken during this
                                             turn.

      (Adv) this may be a feature of the advanced game.
      '-' means there is a limit of 100. You can store on your ship.
      (b) means you can have a maximum of 2 engines.  The types may
      be mixed.  For example, 1 regular engine and one enhanced engine.

      ACTIONS
      Attacking: if you encounter an enemy ship and if an opponent has been
      declared an enemy, and you have energy allocated to the weapons, then
      you will automatically fire on your enemy.  If attacked, your ship
      will automatically return fire if you have sufficient energy
      allocated to weapons.

      Bombardment: Missiles do a good job. Each 2 pts that get through the
      defenses removes 100 people.

      Building Ships: You buy pieces and build ships in space around Alien
      worlds.

      Buying and Selling: Buy or sell anything to an alien world at the
      listed value times the Eco-factor.  This may include your own ore.

      Colonization: For Barren worlds you must Shuttle a CET to the planet
      with at least 1 population unit.  You must have at least 20 people on
      any of the worlds for the population to increase.  But a world is
      considered populated with only 1 person on it.  To own an already
      populated world you must land at least 5 times the number of people
      on that world, otherwise it belongs to the first person who landed
      there.  Bombardment reduces the amount of opponents people on a world.
      You do this by transferring a shuttle to the planet surface.  The
      shuttle is automatically filled and dispersed on the planet's
      surface, and returned to your ship.  Maximum colonist transfered per
      turn is 100 for each shuttle you own. What??  No Shuttles???  NO NEW
      COLONIES!!!

      Communication:  You may communicate with any player in the game with a
      3 x 5 card.  Just put the players ship number and game number on it,
      and I will pass it on to the other player.

      Damage: Damage is applied in this order: shields, armor, Cargo hull,
      scanners, shuttles, drones, spares, Boosters, remaining weapons,
      Cruiser Frame, and finally the Engines.  Once your damage points are
      depleted your are you of the game.

      Declaring: There is a spot to on your turn sheet to declare your
      opponents Ally or Enemy.  This flag is used solely for the purpose of
      initiating combat.

      Dumping: Anything may be dumped off your ship for what ever reason.
      But, if you dump it in space it is not recoverable.  There are
      exceptions.  But that is for you to find out.  In the advanced game I
      may allow recoverable CACHES hidden on planets.

      Repair: Assign the number of spares to a specific damaged location.
      You cannot repair spares or missles.  Anything else is ok to repair.


      Actions (continued)
      Mining: Expend what energy you need to launch your mining drones. The
      drones will return with ore and your turn sheet will have a report on
      the ore and it's worth.  If you have refineries the  report will
      reflect that as well.

      Movement: There are 2 modes of movement.  Normal engine movement and
      Warping from point A to point B.  In normal movement you allocate
      from .5 to 2.5 energy units for 1 - 5 spaces in the direction of
      N,S,E,W and another 1.0 energy point for the extra space using
      boosters.  Or, you can travel by Warp Points.  You'll need a warp
      drive and 2 warp points.  After arriving by regular movement to a
      sector of the players choice, the player uses the transfer command to
      drop  starting warp point.  The player then goes to some other sector
      and drops the end warp point. To use the warp point the player must
      end his turn at either warp point. To use the warp point the player
      merely allocates 3.0 energy units, and use the special command WARP.
      In the advanced game the warp points may be destroyed.

      Population: It increases as follows: 20% On Ship,  20% on Terran
      world, 10% on Sub Terran, 5% on Barren worlds with CET.


      Actions (continued)

      Scanning: This takes place after your move.  On the scanner report
      your ship is not visible, but you are the center most spot.  If you
      are not actually on the world you will have minimum information about
      it.
